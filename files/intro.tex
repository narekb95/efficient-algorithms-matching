Maximum matching is a well studied optimization problem on graphs in the theory of computer science. It was first introduced through assignment problem, in the sense of assigning $n$ workers to $n$ machines to maximize efficiency. In this report, we descirbe in short the main ideas of the problem and its most efficient algorithms, presented in the seminar "Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures - sommer semester 2019 - HU University of Berlin".

The problem has many different varieties. In short, in a given a graph, the goal is to pack pairs of adjacent vertices. In the weighted version of the problem we assign a weight function to each edge and try to find a packing with maximum weight. In this report we are only interested in the unweighted part, where we try to maximize the number of pairs in the packing.

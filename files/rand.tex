In this section, we describe a randomized algorithm, that efficiently checks if a given graph admits a perfect matching. In the exercises, we ask you to use this algorithm to solve the decision version of maximum matching, where given a graph $G$ and a number $k$, we should find if the graph admits a maximum matching of size $k$. Using some exponential search algorithm, we can efficiently use an algorithm for the decision version of a problem to solve the normal version and hence we get a efficient randomized algorithm for maximum matching in general graphs.
